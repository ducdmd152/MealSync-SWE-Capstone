## Product Background
The food and beverage market at Dormitories National University is primarily conducted offline or
through Facebook groups. With a large student population, the demand for food and drinks is
substantial. Recognizing this potential, MealSync was created to help shop owners easily reach
students and provide a more convenient way for students to order food and beverages.
